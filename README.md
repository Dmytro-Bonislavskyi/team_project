## Project Overview
This project uses the US Accident Data from Kaggle to analyze and explore various aspects of road accidents across the United States. Our goal is to identify patterns, relationships, and insights that can help improve infrastructure and enhance transportation safety.

## Description
This project aims to predict the quantity of car accidents in Los Angeles based on weather conditions. The prediction model uses data on weather conditions and the quantity of car accidents over a span of three years. Users can input weather predictions for a day and receive a predicted quantity of car accidents for that day.

## Dataset
We are using the [US Accident Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) from Kaggle, which includes information on accidents, their locations, causes, and impacts.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle: [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?resource=download). The original dataset covers 49 states of the USA, but it was simplified to include only data about car accidents in Los Angeles.

### Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?resource=download)
- **Coverage**: March 22, 2016 to March 31, 2023
- **Features**:
   - Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, etc.)
   - Number of car accidents per day in Los Angeles

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two sprints:

### Sprint 1: Propose and Select Dataset
1. **Propose a dataset**: Each team member suggests a dataset for the project.
2. **Define one dataset to work on**: Review proposed datasets and select the most suitable one (US Accident Data).

### Sprint 2: Explore Dataset and Define Scope
1. **Explore the dataset**:
   - **Primary focus**: Understand the main focus of the dataset.
   - **Explore relationships**: Identify and document potential relationships in the data.

## Key Questions
1. (Primary) How does weather impact accident rates?
2. (Secondary) What are the most common causes of accidents?
3. (Secondary) What times of day are most accidents likely to occur?

## Workflow and Rules of Engagement
- Each team member must create, review, and merge a pull request.
- Each team member must write one PR description.
- The project includes designing, implementing, and testing regression models.
- The README file will be updated with the project explanation, approach, and team rules.

## Implementation
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Understand the structure and primary focus of the dataset.
   - Identify potential relationships in the data.

2. **Analysis and Modeling**:
   - Answer selected questions using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression models.
   - Document findings and insights.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
   - Create and merge pull requests.
   - Write detailed pull request descriptions.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide insights into how weather conditions affect the number of car accidents in Los Angeles. By understanding these patterns, we can potentially enhance public safety measures and prepare better for adverse weather conditions.
