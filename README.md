# Infrastructure & Transportation Project: US Accident Data

## Project Overview
This project uses the US Accident Data from Kaggle to analyze and explore various aspects of road accidents across the United States. Our goal is to identify patterns, relationships, and insights that can help improve infrastructure and enhance transportation safety.

## Dataset
We are using the [US Accident Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) from Kaggle, which includes information on accidents, their locations, causes, and impacts.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two sprints:

### Sprint 1: Propose and Select Dataset
1. **Propose a dataset**: Each team member suggests a dataset for the project.
2. **Define one dataset to work on**: Review proposed datasets and select the most suitable one (US Accident Data).

### Sprint 2: Explore Dataset and Define Scope
1. **Explore the dataset**:
   - **Primary focus**: Understand the main focus of the dataset.
   - **Explore relationships**: Identify and document potential relationships in the data.

## Key Questions
1. (Primary) How does weather impact accident rates?
2. (Secondary) What are the most common causes of accidents?
3. (Secondary) What times of day are most accidents likely to occur?

## Workflow and Rules of Engagement
- Each team member must create, review, and merge a pull request.
- Each team member must write one PR description.
- The project includes designing, implementing, and testing regression models.
- The README file will be updated with the project explanation, approach, and team rules.

## Implementation
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Understand the structure and primary focus of the dataset.
   - Identify potential relationships in the data.

2. **Analysis and Modeling**:
   - Answer selected questions using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression models.
   - Document findings and insights.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
   - Create and merge pull requests.
   - Write detailed pull request descriptions.

## Deliverables
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Regression Models**
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**
- **README file**
- **Individual Learning Videos**
